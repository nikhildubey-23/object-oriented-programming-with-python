What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. OOP promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability by modeling real-world entities and their interactions.

Why Use OOP in Python?
Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language that supports OOP. Using OOP in Python allows you to create clean, organized, and efficient code. It helps you better structure your programs and collaborate with others effectively.

Key OOP Concepts
Classes and Objects
Classes define templates for creating objects. They encapsulate attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. Objects are instances of classes.

Inheritance
Inheritance allows you to create a new class (subclass/derived class) by inheriting attributes and methods from an existing class (base class/parent class). It promotes code reuse and hierarchy.
