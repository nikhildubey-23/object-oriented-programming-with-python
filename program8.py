# How module are made in python?
# before going forward lets see a new thing 
#suppose we made a method to calculate the arithmetic solution it use to execute at once only yes there are many method to control that flow but we see the little professional way for that we use main method
def add(a,b):
    return a+b
def sub(a,b):
    return a-b
def multi(a,b):
    return a*b
def div(a,b):
    return a/b
if __name__ == '__main__':
    add(a,b)
    sub(a,b)
    div(a,b)
    multi(a,b)

# same rest of our import module are made
